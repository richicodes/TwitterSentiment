# TwitterSentiment
Predicts sentiments of tweets with DTM and Neural Network

This was a Analytics Edge project created with my teammates William and Rae.

## The following readme was provided with the project submission

Hello Profs and TAs! This readme file here describes what you need to do to use our code:

1. Libraries and dependencies
Help us ensure that you have the following libraries installed:
- keras
- tensorflow
- tm
- SnowballC
- wordcloud
- textstem

2. Files
Version3Output.rmd
dtm2.r
train.csv
test.csv

Our code only makes use of our dtm file, which we used to partition the code use to make the dtm. This file is named "dtm2.r".
And of course, kindly help to ensure that you have the correct "train.csv" and "test.csv" files handy.

3. Run
That's all!
